            <p>Against The Current have earned accolades and a faithful fan following with their brand of pop, rock, and indie sounds. 
            The group's 2018 sophomore effort Past Lives was praised by Billboard for its “euphoric hooks” and garnered attention from the likes of NME and Upset Magazine, while debut album IN OUR BONES immediately entered Billboard’s 
            “Top New Artists” chart at #2 upon its May 2016 release.  Known for their thrilling live shows, ATC has headlined three of their own world tours, 
            including 2018’s “Past Lives World Tour,” played on Reading and Leeds’ Main Stage in 2019 and were greeted by an in-person audience of 50,000 and nearly 100 million streaming at Beijing National Stadium for their performance of the official 2017 League of Legends World Championship anthem, “Legends Never Die.” 
            The group has built a massive social media audience, racking up more than two million YouTube subscribers and nearly 400 million views, with Costanza becoming one of the most recognizable female voices in the gaming industry and a major online presence all her own. 
            Expanding her impact in the gaming world, Chrissy joined forces with Cailin Russo for the 2019 League of Legends tournament theme “Phoenix,” 
            and is currently the host of VENN's Guest House series, a weekly interactive discovery program showcasing gamers, celebrities, athletes, and musicians.</p>
            <p>Against the Current's music is described as pop rock, pop-punk, alternative rock, and synth-pop in publications. On their second album Past Lives, the band moves away from pop punk; in an interview with Billboard, Costanza reasons "We're all big fans of pop music; this is definitely the direction we’ve always wanted to head in. On this record, we were finally fearless and shed our skin. We wanted to create music that reflected our personalities now and also who we wanted to be."</p>
